# Machine_Learning
This is a collection of machine learning models and related examples.
You can run these examples locally or in the cloud, using Google Colab. Google Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.

=> If you want to run Jupyter notebooks locally, follow the steps below to install Anaconda Python, Tensorflow, and Keras.

# Anaconda Python
```
Install Anaconda version 3.x
Tensorflow 1.13 does not support Python 3.7, so Anaconda must be downgraded to 3.6 to support Tensorflow 1.13.
```
On Windows, it is necessary to run Anaconda Prompt as Administrator for the following step only:
```
conda install python=3.9 (latest version)
```
For the remaining steps, run Anaconda Prompt normally (Administrator is not required):
```
pip install tensorflow==1.15
pip install Keras
```
